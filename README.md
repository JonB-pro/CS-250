How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

    Through the creation of user stories and curation of the Product Backlog user needs can be accurately and timely addressed. 
    Creation of user stories helps in this process by breaking user needs and suggestions into reasonably sized chunks that 
    teams can then work on in a more effective order.
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    In the past I have just seen the code as a whole and worked on it alll at once. This did include pseudocode or a flow chart,
    but was still not broken down into easier to handle sections. The Sprint process is a good practice and I plan to implement 
    it into larger projects that I may have to complete. This can be done by breaking the whole code into easier to manage 
    sections, such as working on individual classes in a package one by one.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

    Being a good team member means adhering to the correct practices of the methods used by your team, respecting your fellow 
    team members and their decision-making processes, being open with your needs and concerns in a constructive way, and being 
    open yourself to constructive criticism.
